- 👋 Hey, I'm @pwbriggs
- 👀 I'm interested in computer security and cryptography, web applications, and preventing e-waste by running cleverly efficient software on older devices.
- 👨‍💻 I build stuff at my company, [@magnusmusmeus](https://github.com/magnusmusmeus/).
- 🗺️ I love to contribute to [OpenStreetMap][osm].
- 🌱 I'm currently learning how to write more secure software: [MIT OCW 6.858, Computer Systems Security][6858].
- ⚡ I contribute most over the summer!
